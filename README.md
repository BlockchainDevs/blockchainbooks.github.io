Since Bitcoin appeared in 2009, the digital currency has been hailed as an Internet marvel and decried as the preferred transaction vehicle for all manner of criminals. It has left nearly everyone without a computer science degree confused: Just how do you “mine” money from ones and zeros? The answer lies in a technology called blockchain, which can be used for much more than Bitcoin. A general-purpose tool for creating secure, decentralized, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain technology has been compared to the Internet itself in both form and impact. Some have said this tool may change society as we know it. Blockchains are being used to create autonomous computer programs known as “smart contracts,” to expedite payments, to create financial instruments, to organize the exchange of data and information, and to facilitate interactions between humans and machines. The technology could affect governance itself, by supporting new organizational structures that promote more democratic and participatory decision making.

Hundreds of blogs, videos, and books claim to explain Bitcoin. Some of them work well, but only if you belong to the right audience. Many works throw non-experts into the deep end without a life vest. Others skip along the surface leaving non-beginners little of value for their time. The result is unsatisfying at best and dangerous at worst. Without the knowledge and confidence to manage your own money, you may entrust it to others - the very situation Bitcoin was created to overturn. All the while, these services gobble up financial secrets for unknown ends. Even if you have no bitcoin, ignorance of Bitcoin's technical underpinnings makes it hard to follow new developments and spot opportunities.
